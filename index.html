			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Currently, Principal UX Consultant for <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/">TPGi</a>, responsible for delivering the highest quality UX and strategy services to clients. I undertake accessibility testing and evaluation, WCAG / Section 508 compliance audits, training, user testing and research, to ensure that websites, web applications and mobile apps are usable and accessible by everyone.</p>

					<h3>Current Projects</h3>
				</summary>
				<p>I am interested in aspects of user interface and user experience design that contribute to feelings of anxiety and panic. I have been exploring how we can avoid or reduce anxiety and panic triggers on the web to improve accessibility for people with anxiety and panic disorders.</p>
				<p>For more information, see my blog post series <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/a-web-of-anxiety-accessibility-for-people-with-anxiety-and-panic-disorders-part-1/">A web of anxiety: accessibility for people with anxiety and panic disorders</a> or view my <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DavidSwallow2/a-web-of-anxiety-accessibility-for-people-with-anxiety-and-panic-disorders">slides from CSUN 2019</a>, and <a href="/files/a11yTO-A_Web_of_Anxiety.pdf">slides from a11yTO 2022</a>.</p>

			<p>Formerly, I was an academic researcher in human-computer interaction at the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/">University of York</a>, where I gained over ten years' experience of designing, developing and evaluating usable and accessible interactive technologies.</p>
			<p>There I achieved a <a href="http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/20686">PhD&nbsp;in&nbsp;Computer&nbsp;Science</a>, investigating how to integrate accessible web development practices into the existing workflows of professional web developers.</p>
