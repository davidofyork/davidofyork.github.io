            <div class="right-column"> <h2>About Me</h2> <p>Currently, a
            Senior Accessibility Engineer for <a
            href="https://www.paciellogroup.com/">The Paciello
            Group</a>. Undertaking accessibility testing and evaluation,
            WCAG/Section 508 compliance audits, training, user testing
            and research, to ensure that websites, web applications and
            mobile apps are usable and accessible by everyone.</p>
            <p>Formerly, an academic researcher in human-computer
            interaction at the <a
            href="https://www.york.ac.uk/">University of York</a>, with
            over ten years' experience of designing, developing and
            evaluating usable and accessible interactive technologies.
            Here I gained a <a
            href="http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/20686">PhD in Computer
            Science</a>, investigating how to integrate accessible web
            development practices into the existing workflows of
            professional web developers.</p> <!-- <p>Engaged in UK and
            European Union-funded research collaborations with
            organisations such as Atos, GOV.UK, Hewlett-Packard and the
            World Wide Web Consortium.</p>--> <p>Prior to that, a web

                <h2>Current Projects</h2> <p>Interested in aspects of
                user interface and user experience design that
                contribute to feelings of anxiety and panic. Exploring
                how we can avoid or reduce anxiety and panic triggers on
                the web to improve accessibility for people with anxiety
                and panic disorders.</p>

                Co-Motion</a>, a £1.2m three-year 'Design for Wellbeing'
                project investigating the links between mobility and
                wellbeing in older people. Engaged in participatory
                design methods and rapid prototyping to develop a mobile
                app for promoting physical activity in older people.</p>

                <p>Undertook a field study evaluation of a mobile app
                for allowing visually impaired people to navigate the
                "last ten yards" to their destination. The <!--<a
                href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/research/impact/optinav/

                <p>Developed a "Virtual Workbench" web app for allowing
                historians to explore medieval charters. Part of the <a
                href="https://chartex.org/">ChartEx</a> project, which
                was an interdisciplinary and international collaboration

                the US.</p>

                <p>Conducted contextual inquiries with web developers
                from across Europe to examine current practices in
                relation to web accessibility. Part of the €2.7m
                EU-funded <a href="http://i2web.eu/">i2Web</a> project,
                which developed tools for creating and evaluating
                accessible websites.</p>

                <p>Administered a large online survey with students and
                educational professionals from across Europe. Delivered
                training in using the W3C Web Content Accessibility
                Guidelines to professional web developers. Part of the

                disabled and older people in education using virtual
                learning environments and other information and
                communication technologies.</p>
