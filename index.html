			<h2>About Me</h2>

					<h3>Current Projects</h3>
				</summary>
				<p>I am interested in aspects of user interface and user experience design that contribute to feelings of anxiety and panic. I have been exploring how we can avoid or reduce anxiety and panic triggers on the web to improve accessibility for people with anxiety and panic disorders.</p>
				<p>For more information, see my blog post series <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/a-web-of-anxiety-accessibility-for-people-with-anxiety-and-panic-disorders-part-1/">A web of anxiety: accessibility for people with anxiety and panic disorders</a> or view my <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DavidSwallow2/a-web-of-anxiety-accessibility-for-people-with-anxiety-and-panic-disorders">slides from CSUN 2019</a>, and <a href="/files/a11yTO-A_Web_of_Anxiety.pdf">slides from a11yTO 2022</a>.</p>
