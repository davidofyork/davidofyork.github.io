			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Currently, a Senior Accessibility Engineer for <a href="https://www.paciellogroup.com/">The Paciello Group</a>. Here I undertake accessibility testing and evaluation, WCAG / Section 508 compliance audits, training, user testing and research, to ensure that websites, web applications and mobile apps are usable and accessible by everyone.</p>

				<summary>
					<h3>Current Projects</h3>
				</summary>
				<p>I am interested in aspects of user interface and user experience design that contribute to feelings of anxiety and panic. I have been exploring how we can avoid or reduce anxiety and panic triggers on the web to improve accessibility for people with anxiety and panic disorders.</p>
				<p>For more information, see my blog post series <a href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2018/08/a-web-of-anxiety-accessibility-for-people-with-anxiety-and-panic-disorders-part-1/">A web of anxiety: accessibility for people with anxiety and panic disorders</a> on The Paciello Group blog or view my <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DavidSwallow2/a-web-of-anxiety-accessibility-for-people-with-anxiety-and-panic-disorders">slides from CSUN 2019</a>.</p>

			<p>Formerly, I was an academic researcher in human-computer interaction at the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/">University of York</a>, where I gained over ten years' experience of designing, developing and evaluating usable and accessible interactive technologies.</p>
			<p>There I achieved a <a href="http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/20686">PhD&nbsp;in&nbsp;Computer&nbsp;Science</a>, investigating how to integrate accessible web development practices into the existing workflows of professional web developers.</p>

				<p>Worked on <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/chp/expertise/co-motion/">Co-Motion</a>, a £1.2m three-year 'Design for Wellbeing' project investigating the links between mobility and wellbeing in older people. Engaged in participatory design methods and rapid prototyping to develop a mobile app for promoting physical activity in older people.</p>
				<p>Undertook a field study evaluation of a mobile app for allowing visually impaired people to navigate the "last ten yards" to their destination. The <!--<a
                href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/research/impact/optinav/

				<p>Conducted contextual inquiries with web developers from across Europe to examine current practices in relation to web accessibility. Part of the €2.7m EU-funded <a href="http://i2web.eu/">i2Web</a> project, which developed tools for creating and evaluating accessible websites.</p>
				<p>Administered a large online survey with students and educational professionals from across Europe. Delivered training in using the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines to professional web developers. Part of the €10.5m EU-funded <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/80191_en.html">EU4ALL</a> project, which developed ways to support disabled and older people in education using virtual learning environments and other information and communication technologies.</p>
